    <p>Fishing at a large lake.</p> <br>
    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>I enjoy fishing when the weather is well and I have spare time. I don't get to go too often, though. I've last went at Holly River; and I was unlucky. I almost caught one, dragging it out of the water and almost into my hands, but it sadly was able to escape back into the stream.</p>
    <h2>Storywriting</h2>
    <p>I aspire to do Forensics and possibly become a great author. The story I am currently writing is known as "Bullet of the Doctor". It's about the fading and obscurity of two identities ; and it blurs the line between villian and hero. I also love Crime shows, explaining my goal for Forensics.</p>
