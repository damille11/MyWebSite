    <p>Russia</p> <br>
    <h2>Why Russia</h2>
    <p>There is lots of rich history and culture there- especially due to the large size of the country. Being the rival for one of the highest World Powers against America, it would be interesting to see what their country is like. They also have a couple interesting places, such as Dyatlov Pass.</p>
