    <h2>Why Bad Boys 3</h2>
    <p>Bad Boys 3 was a great comedy movie. It had an actual decent plot too- with pretty good action involved as well. Trying not to spoil too much in case you want to watch it, though. It featured the very silly duo from both previous movies, and, in my personal opinion, their humor shows the best in the third.</p>
